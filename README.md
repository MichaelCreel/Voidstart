# Voidstart

Voidstart is a custom html page designed to be a useful but non-intrusive new tab. It is designed for productivity, so it only reports weather, saves bookmarks, and saves tasks on a to-do list. It has four default search engines: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo. It also comes with both light mode and dark mode and all settings are saved immediately when they are changed.

## Dependencies

- Web browser that supports opening files as new tabs

## Installation

Currently, there is no proper installation method for this. It may be immediately available on some browsers by opening the .html file in the browser of choice. I was able to get the page to load and work in Mozilla FireFox, but the page would not run as html when put in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, so the page was useless.

## Notes

- Functional but not really useful.
